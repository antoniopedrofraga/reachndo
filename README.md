## What does it solve?

#### ReachN'Do is a location based app which aims to take a determined action considering the user's location in real time.

To give an example, you can configure this app to turn On your WiFi at your work location and home, and turn it off as soon as you exit those places.

## How does it work?

You start with an empty set of Locations.

***

You can use the Google Places API to add a new location and then define it's radius.

When you have a location you can add or remove any Event you want. Those Events can be on entry or exit.

 ## How does it Locate you?
 
  This App locates you using the connection you have turned On and not only GPS, which means that if you only have the Data Connection turned On, it will locate you. However the precision of your location depends on the connections you have available at the time.
